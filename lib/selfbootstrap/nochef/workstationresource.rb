  # The module you have defined may be extended within the recipe to grant the
  # recipe the helper methods you define.
  #
  # Within your recipe you would write:
  #
  #     extend ChefWorkstationInitialize::WorkstationHelpers
  #
  #     my_helper_method
  #
  # You may also add this to a single resource within a recipe:
  #
  #     template '/etc/app.conf' do
  #       extend ChefWorkstationInitialize::WorkstationHelpers
  #       variables specific_key: my_helper_method
  #     end
