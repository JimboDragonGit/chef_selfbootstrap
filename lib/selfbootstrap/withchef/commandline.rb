# The module you have defined may be extended within the recipe to grant the
# recipe the helper methods you define.
#
# Within your recipe you would write:
#
#     extend ChefWorkstationInitialize::CommandlineHelpers
#
#     my_helper_method
#
# You may also add this to a single resource within a recipe:
#
#     template '/etc/app.conf' do
#       extend ChefWorkstationInitialize::CommandlineHelpers
#       variables specific_key: my_helper_method
#     end
